# NCAA Football MCP Tools - Master Implementation Plan

## Vision
Transform the NCAAF MCP server into an intuitive, comprehensive tool that anticipates user needs and provides rich, actionable insights from the extensive GraphQL schema.

## Core Principles
1. **User-Centric Design**: Tools should map to natural user questions
2. **Smart Defaults**: Most relevant data surfaced first (excitement, rankings, etc.)
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Leverage all available schema fields
4. **Predictive Analytics**: Include forward-looking metrics (ELO, win probability, PPA)
5. **Contextual Intelligence**: Understand game importance (conference games, rivalry games)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Query Enhancements (Week 1)
**Goal**: Enhance existing tools with better ordering and additional fields
- Improve query ordering (excitement-based)
- Add missing predictive fields (ELO, win probabilities)
- Include quarter-by-quarter scoring data
- Enhance betting queries with smart sorting

### Phase 2: New Tools for Missing Capabilities (Week 2-3)
**Goal**: Create tools for major schema areas not currently covered
- Recruiting tools (GetRecruits, GetRecruitingClass, GetTopRecruits)
- Transfer portal tools (GetTransfers, GetTransferActivity)
- Coach information tools (GetCoaches, GetCoachHistory)
- Draft analytics tools (GetDraftPicks, GetDraftProjections)

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics Tools (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Build composite analysis tools that combine multiple data sources
- GetMatchupAnalysis (head-to-head deep dive)
- GetTeamMomentum (trend analysis)
- GetWeeklyInsights (comprehensive weekly summary)
- GetPredictedPoints (PPA analytics)

### Phase 4: User Experience Improvements (Week 4-5)
**Goal**: Make tools more intuitive and responsive to natural language
- Smart parameter inference
- Conference-aware defaults
- Season-aware queries
- Natural language aliases

## Success Metrics
- Reduced follow-up queries needed
- More actionable first responses
- Coverage of all major schema entities
- Intuitive tool selection by LLM

## Common User Query Patterns

### Information Seeking
- "What games are this week?" → GetGamesByWeek with excitement ordering
- "How did Alabama do?" → GetTeamGames with recent results
- "Who are the top teams?" → GetRankings with movement analysis
- "What's the spread on the Georgia game?" → GetBettingLines with specific team

### Analysis Queries
- "Is Texas overrated?" → GetAdvancedMetrics + GetRankings comparison
- "Who's going to win Ohio State vs Michigan?" → GetMatchupAnalysis
- "Which games should I watch?" → GetGames sorted by excitement
- "How's recruiting going for LSU?" → GetRecruitingClass

### Betting/Fantasy
- "What are the best bets this week?" → GetBettingAnalysis
- "How does Alabama perform ATS as road underdog?" → GetBettingAnalysis with scenario
- "Which players should I start?" → GetAthletes with performance metrics
- "What's the over/under trend?" → GetBettingLines with O/U analysis

## Technical Improvements

### Query Optimization
- Use compound orderBy for multi-factor sorting
- Implement smart limits based on query type
- Add field aliases for cleaner responses

### Response Formatting
- Consistent YAML structure across tools
- Include calculated fields (spread coverage %, trend indicators)
- Add contextual summaries

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when fields are null
- Helpful error messages with suggestions
- Fallback queries for common issues

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve plan
2. Begin Phase 1 implementation
3. Set up testing framework
4. Create documentation templates
5. Establish feedback loop
