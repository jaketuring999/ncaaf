## Overview
Build composite analysis tools that combine multiple data sources to provide deeper insights. These tools answer complex questions that require correlation across different data types.

## Advanced Composite Tools

### 3.1 GetMatchupAnalysis (Priority: CRITICAL)

#### Implementation
```python
@mcp.tool()
async def GetMatchupAnalysis(
    team1: str,
    team2: str,
    season: Optional[Union[str, int]] = None,
    include_predictions: Optional[Union[str, bool]] = True
) -> str:
    """Comprehensive matchup analysis between two teams.
    
    Combines:
    - Head-to-head history (last 10 games)
    - Current season performance
    - Advanced metrics comparison

    """
```

## Implementation Patterns

### Data Aggregation Strategy
```python
class AnalyticsAggregator:
    """Base class for composite analytics tools"""
    
    async def gather_data(self, params):
        """Parallel data fetching from multiple sources"""
        results = await asyncio.gather(
            self.get_games_data(),
            self.get_metrics_data(),
            self.get_rankings_data(),
            self.get_betting_data()
        )
        return self.combine_results(results)
    
    def calculate_insights(self, data):
        """Derive insights from raw data"""
        # Statistical analysis
        # Trend detection
        # Anomaly identification
        return insights
```

### Caching Strategy
```python
from functools import lru_cache
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class CachedAnalytics:
    @lru_cache(maxsize=128)
    def get_season_stats(self, season):
        """Cache season-wide statistics"""
        pass
    
    def invalidate_if_stale(self, cache_time):
        """Invalidate cache after game day"""
        if datetime.now() - cache_time > timedelta(days=1):
            self.cache.clear()
```

### Response Formatting
```python
def format_analytics_response(data, analysis_type):
    """Consistent formatting for analytics responses"""
    return {
        "summary": generate_summary(data),
        "key_insights": extract_top_insights(data),
        "detailed_analysis": data,
        "confidence": calculate_confidence(data),
        "generated_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Individual calculation functions
- [ ] Data aggregation logic
- [ ] Trend detection algorithms

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Multi-source data gathering
- [ ] Cache behavior
- [ ] Error handling for partial data

### Validation Tests
- [ ] Statistical accuracy
- [ ] Historical backtesting
- [ ] Edge case handling

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques
1. **Parallel Queries**: Use asyncio.gather for concurrent fetching
2. **Smart Caching**: Cache season-wide stats, invalidate post-game
3. **Lazy Loading**: Only fetch detailed data when needed
4. **Query Batching**: Combine related queries

### Performance Targets
- Matchup analysis: < 3 seconds
- Weekly insights: < 5 seconds
- Simple trends: < 2 seconds

## Success Metrics
- User engagement with analytics tools
- Prediction accuracy (track over season)
- Insight relevance (user feedback)
- Query efficiency improvements
